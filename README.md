# NBA Fuzzy Clustering

<i>After using k-means++ to cluster top PGs into two groups using a variety of statistics, we wanted to visualize statistics that did a good job of separating them into clusters. We see here that 3-point percentage is a clear separator.</i> </br></br>
 
This repo explores various centroid-based clustering methods (outlined in slides 1-19) and implements a fuzzy clustering algorithm for NBA player classification as well as several other centroid-based clustering methods (slides 20-40).
